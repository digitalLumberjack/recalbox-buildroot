## RECALBOX - SYSTEM N64 ##

Put your nintendo 64 roms in this directory.

Rom files must have a ".n64", ".v64 or ".z64 extension.

You can download n64 roms on planetemu :
http://www.planetemu.net/roms/nintendo-nintendo-64


Note : N64 emulation is in beta.
The emulator used to emulate N64 on recalboxOS is a standalone mupen64plus version, and not a retroarch one. So you won't have acces to special commands, using Hotkey, as the others emulators.
This emulator is not integrated to the recalbox's configuration generator. So you will be oblige to configure it manually.

If you have problems about unrecognized controller or black screen with return to Emulationstation, please read wikis below :
